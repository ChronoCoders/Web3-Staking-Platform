# Web3 Staking Platform

A decentralized staking platform built with Ethereum smart contracts and Web3 technologies. Users can stake tokens, earn rewards, and interact with the platform through a secure, transparent interface.

## Features

* **Stake Tokens**: Stake-supported tokens into decentralized pools
* **Earn Rewards**: Automatically earn rewards based on your staked amount
* **Time-Locked Staking**: Higher rewards for longer commitment periods
* **Secure and Transparent**: Built using Ethereum smart contracts ensuring trustless and secure transactions
* **Web3 Integration**: Interact with the platform via MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, or Trezor

## Tech Stack

* **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, OpenZeppelin
* **Frontend**: React.js, Web3.js, Recharts
* **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Hardware wallets
* **Development**: Truffle, Hardhat, Ethers.js
* **Testing**: Mocha, Chai
* **Deployment**: GitHub Actions, AWS, Firebase
